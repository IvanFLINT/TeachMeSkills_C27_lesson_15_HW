<h4>Task1:</h4> The program creates a collection of integers and fills it with the values entered from the console. Displays even numbers from the collection on the screen:
<ul>
 <li>The InputService class contains a getIntList method for entering data into the list. Converts string data to integers.</li>
 <li>The PrintEaven class contains a validator method for finding even numbers in a list.</li>
 <li>The Runner class calls the getIntList method from the InputService class</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task2:</h4> The program creates a collection of shapes. and calls a method to calculate and display the perimeter of each shape:
<ul>
 <li>In the Runner class, the main method calls the service method.</li>
 <li>The Service class contains a service method that creates shape objects and displays the result of the methods in a list.</li>
 <li>The abstract class Figure contains the perimeter Calculation method for calculating the perimeter.</li>
 <li>The Circle class contains the perimeterCalculation method, inherited from the abstract Figure class. Contains fields with variables for calculating the perimeter.</li>
 <li>The Rectangle class contains the perimeterCalculation method, which is inherited from the abstract Figure class. Contains fields with variables for calculating the perimeter.</li>
 <li>The Square class contains the perimeterCalculation method, which is inherited from the abstract Figure class. Contains fields with variables for calculating the perimeter.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task3:</h4> The program creates a collection of integers. Fills them with random numbers. Calculates and displays the arithmetic mean of all elements in the collection:
<ul>
 <li>The Runner class calls the arithmetical Mean method in its main method. Implemented an input error exception.</li>
 <li>The InputService class has a method inputService that takes the Scanner class as input. Creates a list and fills it with random numbers. The output is ArrayList<Integer>.</li>
 <li>The GetArrey class has an arithmeticalMean method that takes an ArrayList<Integer> as input. Calculates the arithmetic mean of the elements of a list.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task4:</h4> The program creates a collection of unique names of all students in our group + teacher. And displays it on the screen:
<ul>
 <li>The Runner class in the main method calls the service method to process the list.</li>
 <li>The Service class consists of a service method that processes the file and outputs information to the console.</li>
 <li>The C27onlGroup interface contains the path to the group list file.</li>
 <li>The file directory contains the file grup.txt which contains the group list.</li>
</ul>
